I've tried to translate `gtk4 layout transformation` demo to vala before, but couldn't finish it because of - for me - unknown linear algebra math. Here I try to rewrite it form scratch. Unfortunately it doesn't work till now :(.
Any help appreciated.

### Prerequisites

```
gtk4 4.0.0
vala 0.50.1
gnu scientific library v2.6
```

### Installing

This is a meson project. You know how it works.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Doesn't work.
